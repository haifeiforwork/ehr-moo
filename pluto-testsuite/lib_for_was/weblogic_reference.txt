Kevin,

I think you deserve more than 10 points for walking me through this. I can finally see my JSR168 portlet on my sample.portal page. All I did on this last part was manually go to the JSP file on the server and change the http://java.sun.com/portlet_2_0 to http://java.sun.com/portlet. Then it worked!

I still have questions about how I can get the patch for the import tool but I will make that a different thread.

I couldn't imagine going through all of this for a portlet that has more files than the minimum number that my test portlet had.

Thanks so much for all the help,
Barbara

Hello Barbara,

Glad you got it to work!

The JSP tag library issue you would have run into using the JSR168 import tool as well; the issue there is that WLP 10.3 just doesn't support JSR286 yet.

If you are developing additional portlets from scratch, you can just start off by putting them all in the same webapp; you don't need to make each one its own WAR. That makes it vastly easier to get everything running too!

Kevin
